Java Dependency Injection - General Pattern

di-general implies Java DI in general.
This code is basically from [JournalDev](https://www.journaldev.com/2394/java-dependency-injection-design-pattern-example-tutorial)

Used Intellij IDE to execute and understand. Initial code was not compiling.
Made changes related to test files. Moved them to src/test/java. Also added pom.xml for easy building with Maven.
Under test folder "individual.tests", placed two tests which have Main method and can be executed directly.

This Java DI code can be directly imported with Eclipse or Intellij. And current observation is with Intellij Community Edition.
